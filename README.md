# QuickNote App

Elegant note-taking application for Android and iOS using Flutter, leveraging the sqflite for local storage.


## ðŸ“£About
QuickNote app is a flutter application which can be used to store the notes and we used flutter's SQFLITE plugin. I have performed simple CRUD operations on Notes(Create, Update, Select, Delete). It will be a good reference for anyone searching how to work with sqflite in flutter and saving data locally.
